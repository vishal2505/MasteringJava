# Factory Design Pattern

## Properties

1. Creational Design Pattern

2. Used when we have multiple sub-classes of a super class and based on input we want to return one class instance

3. It provides abstraction between  implementaion and client classes

4. Remove the instantiation of client classes from client code



## Implementaion

1. Super class can be interface or abstract class or basic class.

2. Factory class has a static method which returns the instance of sub class based on input.
